# AWS Free-Tier Account Setup

## Steps Taken:
1. **Created an AWS account** via the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) page.
2. **Completed identity verification** using a phone number and billing details.
3. **Signed into AWS Console** and explored services like EC2, S3, and Lambda.
4. **Used AWS Pricing Calculator** to estimate potential costs.

## Lessons Learned:
- AWS requires a **credit/debit card** even for free-tier accounts.
- Free-tier services have **limits** (e.g., 750 hours/month for EC2 t2.micro).
- **Billing alerts** can be set up via AWS Budgets to avoid unexpected charges.
- Some services are **always free**, while others expire after **12 months**.
